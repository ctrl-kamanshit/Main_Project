it Creates:

pyproject.toml:-This will show you the details of the project

.python-version:-This will tell you the version of the python

## After initializing we will create an virtual enviornment for our project
```bash
uv venv
```
🐍 What is venv?

venv = Virtual Environment

It creates an isolated Python environment for your project.

That means:

Each project can have its own packages

## Activating the venv

In windows write on terminal
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

In mac
```
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install numpy
pip install pandas

```
uv add numpy pandas

In terminal write
```
uv run main.py
or
python main.py
